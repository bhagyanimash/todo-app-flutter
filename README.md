# todo-app
This simple ToDo app allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete using a checkbox, and delete them when no longer needed. Completed tasks are visually distinguished by a green background, providing a clear view of what's been accomplished. The app also saves tasks locally, so they remain available even after closing the app.
